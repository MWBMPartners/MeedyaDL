  Entitlements.plist — macOS Hardened Runtime Entitlements
  ========================================================

  These entitlements are required for the macOS code-signed, notarised build.
  MeedyaDL spawns Python subprocesses (GAMDL, votify) and loads unsigned
  Python C-extension modules (.so), which the hardened runtime would normally
  block.

  Entitlements:
    1. allow-unsigned-executable-memory
       Permits Python's JIT-like memory operations and ctypes usage.

    2. disable-library-validation
       Allows loading unsigned .so modules (e.g., pip-installed packages
       compiled from C sources) without requiring them to be signed by
       the same team identity.

    3. network.client
       Permits outbound network connections for downloading media,
       checking for updates, and communicating with Apple Music APIs.
