### 🧹 Maintenance

- Update version to 0.1.3 in Cargo.lock and enhance project documentation

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-12

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Resolve blank screen on macOS/Windows release builds

Fix React infinite re-render loop (error #185) that caused the UI to
  flash briefly then go blank in production builds. Three root causes:

  1. UpdateBanner: Zustand selector called getActiveUpdates() which uses
     .filter(), creating a new array reference on every store change.
     Zustand's Object.is() equality check always saw a new reference,
     triggering cascading re-renders. Fixed by subscribing to raw data
     (lastResult, dismissed) and deriving via useMemo.

  2. Sidebar: Subscribed to isReady function reference (always stable)
     instead of actual dependency state. The status dot never updated.
     Fixed by subscribing to python/gamdl status objects directly.

  3. App.tsx: Subscribed to entire settings object, causing full subtree
     re-renders on any settings change. Narrowed to sidebar_collapsed.
     Also replaced reactive isReady subscription with imperative
     getState() check in initialization effect.

  Additional changes:
  - Add CSP connect-src for Tauri IPC (ipc: http://ipc.localhost)
  - Add ErrorBoundary to main.tsx for visible crash diagnostics
  - Add Vite build config (target, envPrefix) per Tauri 2.0 guide
  - Enable devtools Cargo feature for WebView inspection
  - Open DevTools automatically in debug builds
  - Simplify Windows release: drop x86, produce only NSIS .exe (no .msi)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-02-12

### ✨ Features

- Integrate release-please for automated release PRs

Add Google's release-please to automatically create Release PRs when
  conventional commits land on main. When merged, the PR creates a tag
  that triggers the existing 7-platform release build. git-cliff continues
  to own CHANGELOG.md (release-please has skip-changelog: true). The
  manual version-bump workflow is preserved as an override for non-standard
  releases.

- Update CHANGELOG.md [skip ci]
- Add macOS Gatekeeper fix to release notes

Unsigned apps trigger macOS Gatekeeper's "damaged" warning. Add
  instructions to run xattr -cr to remove the quarantine flag.

- Update CHANGELOG.md [skip ci]

### 🧹 Maintenance

- Add auth/ to .gitignore to prevent secret leaks

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-11

### ✨ Features

- Add release automation and expand to 7 platform targets

Add one-command release automation via Version Bump workflow
  (workflow_dispatch) that bumps versions across all source files,
  commits, tags, and triggers the release build. Expand the release
  build matrix from 3 to 7 platform targets: macOS ARM64, Windows
  x64/x86/ARM64, Linux x64/ARM64/ARMv7 (Raspberry Pi).


### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Make usePlatform fallback test deterministic across CI runners

Mock navigator.userAgent with a known Windows UA string instead of
  relying on the host platform's default jsdom userAgent. This fixes
  the test failure on Ubuntu runners where the userAgent contains
  "linux" instead of "darwin".
